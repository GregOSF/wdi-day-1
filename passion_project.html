	<h2>Create A Travel Website That Caters To Trekkers and Backpackers</h2>
	<p>The general idea:  People who want to plan trekking or backpacking trips (i.e., more than one week/specific destination) can plug in certain keywords representing what they want out of their excursion, and the website returns personalized suggestions on what their ideal itinerary would be based on the keywords or other parameters (e.g., price, hostels/campsites, hike difficulty, notable landmarks, food, travel length, etc.). If the itinerary is accepted by the user, website links to best deals for booking/reservervations in accordance with dates of intinerary.</p>
