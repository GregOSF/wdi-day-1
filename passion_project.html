	<h2>Create a travel website that caters to trekkers and backpackers</h2>
	<li>The general idea is people who are on trekking or backpacking trips (i.e., more than one week/specific destination) can plug in certain keywords representing what they want out of their excursion, and website returns personalized suggestions on ideal itinerary (lodging, notable landmarks, food, etc.). </li>
